# PyBer Ride-Sharing Data Analysis
#
## Overview of the Analysis
#
The intent of the new analysis is to study several month's worth of ride-sharing data with respect to type of region and number of drivers. The analysis should bring forward trends and patterns that can further be used to optimize or enhance the profitability as well as end user value.

## Summary
The data clearly shows that urban ride-sharing generates almost twice the revenue than suburban and nearly four times the revenue when compared with the rural setting in any given month. If the cost-price ratios are similar in all settings, PyBer can consider reallocation of assets from rural to urban regions.
